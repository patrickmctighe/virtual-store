An online store dedicated to offering state-of-the-art weather control systems. Developed with React and powered by Vite, this website showcases my proficiency in crafting highly reactive interfaces, utilizing props, and managing state effectively to ensure a seamless user experience.

Throughout the development process, I've demonstrated extensive use of props and setState, enabling dynamic content delivery and real-time updates as users interact with the site. Additionally, I've leveraged the capabilities of React Router to facilitate smooth navigation, enhancing the overall usability of the application.

Furthermore, by integrating React seamlessly with vanilla JavaScript functions, I've achieved synergistic effects that contribute to the site's functionality and performance. With Jest ensuring robust testing and Netlify handling deployment, this project represents a comprehensive demonstration of my skills in React development and web deployment.
